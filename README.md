# Theatre Bills

Digitize your Playbills! 

Maybe you're like me: I love my playbills, but unless they're autographed, I honestly don't want to keep them around gathering dust lol Theatre Bills comes in. Take a pic of your Playbill cover, and add details like theatre's name, title, and playwright. As the app grows, you'll be able to see a map with pins of the shows you've been to!
